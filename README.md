# openReadingFramesinC-
Decided to do the Rosalind Open Reading Frames problem in C#. I was looking to learn C# for future work and this seemed to be a good way to start. Previous OOP from Java helped even if it has been ages. Would've been much faster in python, but I really do enjoy the stability and checking that comes with OOP.
